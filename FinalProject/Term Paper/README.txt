In this subdirectory you can find my term paper for COMP4630 (Fall 2021) about my final project
Twitch Clips Finder. In addition you can find my name to make the connection between my real name
and GitHub user ID. In this readme you'll see the abstract to my paper and the resources I used
during development.


Abstract:
From idea to implementation, Twitch Clips Finder is an app that’s goal is to improve the clip 
searching and watching experience. Since the official Twitch app focuses on the live streaming 
content from Twitch, Twitch Clips Finder aims to offer a solution for Twitch users lacking the 
time to dedicate to an entire live stream. Twitch clips are short segments taken from live streams 
but using the official Twitch app can be notoriously difficult to find. I have designed and 
implemented Twitch Clips Finder to make this process as effortless as possible by offering more 
filtering capabilities that can be accessed in a central location unlike in the Twitch app. Users 
don’t have to leave the app to watch the clips, as the Twitch video player is directly embedded in 
the app. In addition to much other quality of life improvements, Twitch Clips Finder improves upon 
the clip searching and watching experience while simultaneously teaching me how to design and 
implement a mobile app.
