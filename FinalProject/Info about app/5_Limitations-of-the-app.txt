	Everything that I implemented and discussed in my term paper and my how-to-use-the-app text file is working as it should and has been bug tested. There shouldn’t be any issues when running the app because I added warning messages that are displayed when the user is doing something they shouldn’t or what they are searching for doesn’t exist. You may run into a corner case that I didn’t think of, but this should be limited.

       When designing my app, I was hoping to have a chatroom replay below the clip video player functional but due to limitations of the Twitch API this wasn’t possible. Since Twitch is revamping their API, they haven’t migrated all their features to their latest version of the API and the chatroom replay functionality isn’t available yet. I discovered that using a third-party website there is a workaround to implement that chatroom replay but Twitch advised developers not to use this approach. To replace this feature, I added a recommended clip that is like the one that is playing below the clip video player. I found that this feature is quite useful since users can keep progressing through clips if they found a streamer they enjoy watching.

	Another limitation that I didn’t discover until I implemented the feature is the open the clip in Twitch button. It opens the live stream that the clip was taken from at the point when the clip was created. After implementing the feature, I realized that this feature won’t always work because of another limitation from Twitch. Some Twitch streamers delete their streams, and some make the saved version of their streams only accessible to their subscribers who pay for their content. Additionally, Twitch allows most streamers to save their streams for up to three months and are deleted after. Meaning some of the time this button will display a message telling the user that the stream was unavailable because the stream was deleted by the streamer, Twitch, or placed behind a paywall.
